# Welcome to Patrick's Class 102 Notes

### Growth Mindset
Have you ever been given a task that was so challenging and you contimplated on giving up, but instead you found alternate routes to complete that task? Having a growth mindset is when you get frustrated and you want to quit, but you don't give up until the job is finished. It's when you fail at a challenge and look at that failure as an opportunity to grow instead of beat yourself up about it. Having a growth mindset is where you don't mind trying out new things in life. Most importantly it is when you use feedback and criticism to grow as a person and as an employee or coworker in your industry. 

### Reminders of how to keep a Growth mindset 

- **Feedback & Criticism are the greatest assets to make you into a better person.**
- **Keep practicing day after day until you become proficient.**
- **Look for challenges to help improve your skills.**
- **Surround yourself with positive people and use them as insperation.**
