# How do Computers Work?

## What are 4 things common to computers?

1. Input: Is what you are telling the computer to do, for example typing on the computer or moving your mouse around.
2. Storage: Memory 
3. Processing: Is a series of commands that process information. 
4. Output: Is the information that you are pushing back out to the internet. 

## What is Data and Binary?

- Binary Code: Is a code made up of 0's and 1's and is a big role that helps the computer work on the inside. 
- A 1 or 0 is called a bit in the binary value. A collection of 8 bits is called a byte. 
- When you look into the memory bank of a computer, you will notice that a common name given to the storage is byte.
- When you open up a computer, you will notice a bunch of wires. Another word for those wires are called circuits. 
- A single wire stores a small amount of numbers, but when you add more wires you can have a larger amount of numbers. 

- The Central Processing Unit pushes the information through the correct circuit in order to output the information. 

## What are Hardware and Software

1. Operating System- Main Program that controls how the software should utilize the hardware that is internal to the computer. 
2. Software: Code
3. Hardware: circuits, wires, cpu, sound card, mother board.
