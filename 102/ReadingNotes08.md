# Operators and Loops

## Operators
*You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value of the script to where you expect it to be and the result will be true or false.*
- == is equal to 
- === strict equal to 
- != is not equal to 
- !== strict not equal to 
- > greater than
- >= greater than or equal to 
- < Less than 
- <= less than or equal to 

## Logical Operators 
*allows you to compare the results of multiple comparison operators*
- && Logical and: tests multiple conditions. 
- || Logical or: Tests at least one condition.
- ! Logical not: Takes a single boolean value and inverts it. 

## Loops
*Check the condition, once it comes back true then a code block will run.*

**The three different types of loops**
1. For loop: is when you run a code a specific number of times. 
2. While loop: is used when you dont know how many times you should be running the code. 
3. Do While loop: This loop will continue to run the loop in a curly braces even if the condition comes back as false.
