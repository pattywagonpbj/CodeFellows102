## The Evolution of HTML 

- *HTML 4*: Started in 1997 and only had a few presentational elements that only allowed you to do certain things. 
- *XHTML 1.0*: Started in 1998, it allowed people to use a new markup language and it also had more rules when using it. 
- *HTML 5*: Still is in a work of progress, but this new markup language changed certain rules when using it, for example now you do not have to use a closing tag every time.
