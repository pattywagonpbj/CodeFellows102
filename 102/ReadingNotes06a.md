# Java Script

## How does HTML, CSS, and Java Script come together?

Well there are three different layers that create a website. Those layers are:

1. Content Layer (HTML): This layer adds structure.
2. Presentation Layer (CSS): This page is the layer that has all of the rules and tells you how you are presenting the page.
3. Behavior Layer (Javascript): This is where we can add some interactivity to the page to keep the attention of the customer or client. 

## What elements can you use?

- The HTML <script> element is what pushes the javascript file into the program. When adding a <script> element, the program will stop to load the script and then it will run it and try to figure out if any new information needs to be added.
- The "document" element represents the web page
- When you add "write()" method it allows you to add stuff into the web page.
- You must add parameters "()" around the method in order for the document to work properly to add the specific information in.  

## Basic Java Script Instructions

What is a Script and what is its purpose? 

- It is a series of instructions that the program will follow one-by-one and every single step is known as a statement. 
- Always remember that a step will be ending with a semicolon. 
- Remember to always add comments to your code, in the long run it will make it easier for everyone to understand what the code is doing. 


## What are Variables and how is it important?

A variable is a temporary storage that stores some information from the script. It is important because the data stored can be changed every time a script runs. 

Variable example: var quantity: "var" is the variable keyword and "quantity" is the variable name.

To assign a value to a variable it would look like this: quantity=3; "quantity=variable name, = is the assignment operator, 3= variable value"

## Different Data Types

1. Numeric data type: This data type handles numbers, "5.25".
2. String data type: This data type is constructed of letters and other characters, " 'what's up, Chris".
3. Boolean data type: This data is strictly true or false.
