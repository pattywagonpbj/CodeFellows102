# Reading Note 01

## Summary of Markdown

Markdown is a way to format text(s) when it comes to the web. You can control a web page and the codes in that page. There are different ways to change the style of texts from words that are "bold" to "italics". Some of the other things you can add are images, links, headers, or quotes.

## Examples
1. For headers you would use tags such as an h1, h2, or h3. These tags are simple hashtags(shift 3). For h1 it's a simple hashtag, h2 it's just double hashtags.
1. For emphasising you would use the star(shift 8) on both sides of the phrase. *This phrase will be italic*
1. For a link it's using both the brackets and the parenthesis. [the name of the subject](the link for the site)
