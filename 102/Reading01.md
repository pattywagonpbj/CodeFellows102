# Reading Note 01

## Summary of Markdown

Markdown is a way to format text(s) when it comes to the web. You can control a web page and the codes in that page. There are different ways to change the style of texts from words that are "bold" to "italics". Some of the other things you can add are images, links, headers, or quotes.

## Examples
1. For headers you would use tags such as an <h1>, <h2>, or <h3>. These tags are simple hashtags "#". For <h1> it's a simple #, <h2> it's just adding another hashtag ##.
1. For emphasising you would us the "*" or "_" on both sides of the phrase. *This phrase will be italic*
1. For a link it's using both the "[]" and the "()". [the name of the subject](the link for the site)
