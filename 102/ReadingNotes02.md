GitHub Pages is a site that allows you to build repositories which will later become websites. You can build resumes, projects, portfolios, etc. Another thing that GitHub pages helps you with is a better publishing experience by changing regular old text files into websites by using another program called "Jeckle". When you use Jeckle it allows you to control the format and presentation of your site. GitHub also builds and deploys your site for you.
