## What is a Text Editor?

It's a piece of software that gets installed onto your computer and it allows you to control your text that you write to build your website. It has many different features that are important. 

IDE or Integrated Development Environment, has many different applications that can help the Text Editor. They can also be used as a file manager and debugger. 

For example:
- **Code Completion**
- **being able to highlight your syntax**
- **different themes**

Code completion is when you are typing something out and then the feature will pop up some suggestions based on what you are typing out. It also allows you to be more efficient when you are writing your HTML or CSS.

Syntax Highlighting is simple, it takes what you type out and allows you to add some color to your text itself. 

Having different themes allows you to change the background, different colors in your text, and themes can also affect different aspects of the text editing software.

There are different shells out there and one of the most common shell is called "bash".
