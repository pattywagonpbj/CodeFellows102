## How to use CSS Color?

Two major different ways to use color:

- Foreground Color: Allows you to choose the color of the texts that is inside of the box or element. 

- Background Color: Allows you to pick the color of the box that your element is in. 

You can pick any color in CSS in these three ways:
1. RGB Values: This expresses how much color you use to make that specific color or colors. 
1. HEX Codes: Six-digit codes that represent the amount of colors that the specific color is made of. 
1. Color Names: The amount of predefined colors names are 147 and they are recognized by the browser. 

Every color on a computer screen is made up of specific colors, those are red, green, and blue. 
- If you want to pick a specific color or find a specific color and what amount of colors makes that up; you can use a color picker. 

 ## Contrast

 When deciding what kind of contrast you want to use, you first have to make sure that the text within the boxes are legible to read with whatever color is your background. 

 - Different kinds of contrast includes:
 1. Low
 1. Medium
 1. High

 **Just remember that when you use color, you are creating a mood for any audience that is looking at your website.**
