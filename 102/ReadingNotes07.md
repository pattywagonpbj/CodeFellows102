## What is a Script?

- Is a series of instructions that a program can follow to achieve a goal. 
- The instructions that the computer will follow are step-by-step.
- When using the browser it may use different parts of the script, but that also depends on how you as the user interacts with the web page. 
- Depending on the situation, scripts can run different sections of the code in response. 

## What are Expressions and Operators?

*An expression evaluates into a single value and there are two types of expressions*:

1. Expressions that assaign a value to a variable.
2. Expressions that use tow or more values to return a single value.

- **Assignment Operators**: Assign a value to a variable
- **Arithmetic Operators**: Perform basic math. 
- **String Operators**: Combine two strings.
- **Comparison Operators**: Compare two values and return true or false.
- **Logical Operators**: Combine expressions and retun true or false.

## What are some of the Functions?

 *Allows you to group a series of statements together to perform certain tasks*.
1. Parameters: Pieces of information that is passed to a specific function.
2. Return Value: A response from the function.
3. Declaring a Function: Give it a name and write out the statements that are needed to complete the task. 
4. Calling a Function: Execute all of the statements between the curly braces with one line of code.
